# PiratesTalk
A simple utility who gets a sentence/word as an input and translates it into pirate jargon

For this purpose the service: http://isithackday.com/arrpi.php is used.

In order to run the program simply clone it, and from the root folder of the project do:
```python
python main.py
```

Please mind that this is only tested with python 3.

Feel free to contact me if you want to extend this script or having questions.
